    2. Trophies will be given to the undefeated Debate teams.
    3. Award recipients shall appear in tournament dress.  Student not dressed appropriately will be asked to sit down; their coach may pick up their awards after the ceremony concludes.
A.  Sweepstakes Awards
    1. Each tournament's award ceremony shall include recognition of team sweepstakes awards.
    1. The tournament tabulation team will be responsible for generating all sweepstakes-related result reports.
    1. The top 5 schools shall be announced for sweepstakes results, with the top school earning custody of the traveling sweepstakes trophy. This trophy can be an informal trophy, like a broom (to represent the "sweeps" win). The winning school is required to return the traveling trophy at the start of the next league tournament.
    1. State-qualifying tournaments will combine the sweepstakes points earned from all state-qualifying tournaments and award the trophy at the conclusion of the final qualifying tournament. This team earns the title of 'league champion' for the competitive season.
    1. Sweepstakes awards are not tabulated for NSDA qualifying tournaments, as NSDA has their own mechanism ("trophy points") for school performance.
    1. Sweepstakes awards are based solely on a school's performance in the guaranteed ("prelim") rounds of a tournament.
    1. Each entry earns points per round of competition:
        i.  Debate: Win = 6 points, Bye = 4 points, Loss = 3 points
        i.  Congress: 9 points minus rank in the round (eg. 1st = 8 points), minimum 2 points
        i.  Presiding Officer: 4 points per round presided
        i.  Speech: 7 points minus rank in the round (eg. 1st = 6 points), minimum 2 points
    1. School Sweepstakes awards are calculated based on the sum of the school's top 6 entries for debate, and top 10 entries for speech.
        i.  Note: this structure ensures that bringing more students helps a team's sweepstakes performance, but that large schools do not automatically win by virtue of having the most entries.
    1. Novice and Varsity entries both count toward sweepstakes points; there are not separate categories for Novice and Varsity sweepstakes.
    1. Additional sweepstakes awards for small schools (with lower numbers of entries) can be recognized, at the discretion of the league President.
A.  Team MVP Awards
    1. Each tournament's award ceremony shall include a "Team MVP" section, highlighting the top sweepstakes points-earner from each school.
    1. Team MVP is calculated on an entry-by-entry basis. Double-entering does NOT improve a student's Team MVP score (eg. a student who earns 7 points in Dramatic will earn MVP over a double-entered student from the same school that earns 4 sweepstakes points in Impromptu and 5 sweepstakes points in Oratory).
    1. In the event of a tie, recognize all tied entries from the school.
    1. There is no requirement for a physical award for Team MVPs. The league can offer a small award for Team MVPs, such as a pin or sticker, at the discretion of the Vice President. However, it is just as acceptable to ask Team MVPs to rise when their name is called, single-clap them, and then have them remain standing for a round of applause once all MVPs are standing.

    1. Each tournament's award ceremony shall include verbal recognition of a team award called the Spirit of Speech and Debate Award.
    1. Each school at a tournament is allowed to nominate one other school for this award.

    1. Nominations for Spirit of Speech and Debate must be submitted 30 minutes prior to the actual start of the awards ceremony.
    1. The secretary has discretion to disregard nominations that seem improper or that do not align to the spirit of the award. In the event of multiple award nominees, the secretary may choose a nominated school based on the quantity and quality of nominations for a given school.
    1. The winner shall be announced at the tournament's awards ceremony. There is no physical award associated with this award. It is just a recognition of good community-building. The winner can be posted on the Tabroom website, if desired.

    1. At the conclusion of each tournament, no later than 12PM the day after the tournament's end, the league Secretary shall send a nomination form to coaches, to be used for nominating outstanding judges.

    5. CVFL Secretary will compile nominations and votes for delivery to the President as soon as voting closes.
    6. Award given shall be named "Orator's Cup".

A.  Coaches will send their registration via the Tabroom.com website thirty-six hours prior to the tournament.
