# Overview
The Capitol Valley Forensics League (CVFL) follows the California High School Speech Association (CHSSA) rules as closely as possible, given the constraints of smaller tournament sizes and judging availability. Below are the CVFL-specific rules for qualification to the state tournament.

## Bracket Creation
A.  After Round 3, teams with one or fewer losses advance to elimination rounds.
A.  Teams are seeded based on:
    1. Number of debates won.
    1. Average seed of opponents faced.

## Elimination Rounds
A.  Brackets are set as follows:
    1. If 8 or fewer advancing entries, start with quarter-finals.
    1. If 9-16 advancing entries, start with octo-finals.
    1. Pairings are set with 1st vs. 8th/16th, 2nd vs. 7th/15th, etc.
        1. Byes fill remaining slots if necessary (eg. if no 16th seed, 1st seed gets a bye).
    1. Single elimination until the final qualifying round.

## Final Qualifiers
A.  Winners of the final qualifying round automatically qualify.
A.  Additional qualifiers are determined from the best-performing final-round-losing entries based on:
    1. Number of ballots won.
    1. Number of debates won.
    1. Opponents' cumulative ballots won.
    1. Opponents' cumulative ballots won against them.

# Congressional Debate

## Preliminary Rounds
A.  Number of chambers determined by entries and presiding officers (typically two chambers for entry counts above 20).
A.  Three preliminary rounds with static chamber assignments.
A.  Presiding Officers (POs) rotate chambers to ensure exposure.

## Breaks to Finals
A.  Ranks to finals determined by:
    1. Lowest cumulative total rank (truncated to 10).
    1. Judges' preference in head-to-head ties.
    1. Reciprocal ranks (truncated to 10).

## Final Rounds
A.  Equal numbers of competitors from each chamber advance to finals (e.g., seven from each in a two-chamber setup).
A.  Final scoring:
        1. Lowest cumulative ranks from preliminaries and finals (finals ranks doubled, truncated to 10).
        1. Ranks from the finals round.
        1. Judges' preference from finals.
        1. Reciprocal ranks from the finals.
        1. Reciprocal ranks from all rounds.

## Judging
A.  Preliminary rounds: three judges per chamber.
A.  Final round: at least three judges.

# Presiding Officer Competition
A.  POs are ranked based on votes from students and judges in each round.
A.  Top two POs with the most votes advance to finals, with total votes serving as the tie-breaker.

## Procedural Guidelines

POs maintain decorum and enforce CHSSA guidelines, including recency, and speaking times.

# Additional Notes

Debate events typically do not run full 16-entry brackets due to judging constraints. Smaller brackets (e.g., quarter-finals) streamline the schedule and ensure smoother operations.

These rules aim to balance adherence to CHSSA guidelines with the practical needs of our league.
