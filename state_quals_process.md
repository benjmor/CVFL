# Overview

The Capitol Valley Forensics League (CVFL) follows the California High School Speech Association (CHSSA) rules as closely as possible, given the constraints of smaller tournament sizes and judging availability. CVFL state qualifier tournaments shall adhere to CVFL Bylaws, where relevant. Below are the CVFL-specific procedures for qualification to the CHSSA state tournament.

## General and Administrative Information

1. Tournaments will be held at locations as published on the [CVFL website](cvfl.org/tournamentschedule). 
1. Tournaments will be tabulated by the league President and Vice-Preisdent or their designee(s).

## Protests

Protests shall follow procedures outlined in CVFL Bylaw Article V, "Section 1: General Administration."

## Eligibility

For student eligibility details, see CVFL Bylaw Article IV, "Section 2: Student participation."

## Auto-Qualification

For debate auto-qualification details, see CVFL Bylaw Article IV, "Section 8: Debate Tabulation."

## Judge Training Requirements

CVFL does not require specific judge training, though highly recommends reviewing the judge training recordings that are sent to registered judges the week of each tournament.

# Speech Events

Speech rounds will be judged by 1 judge per preliminary round and 3 judges per semi-final and final round.

## Low-judge contingency exception

If insufficient judges are available to allocate 3 judges per semi-final round, 1-judge rooms may be used, with tiebreakers updated to weight the semi-final equally to preliminary rounds. Events with fewest total entrants should be switched to 1-judge rooms before other events.

## Preliminary Rounds

A.  Events with more than 14 entries:
      1. Two rounds of preliminaries.
      1. Semi-finals with up to 14 competitors.
      1. Finals with seven competitors.
A.  Events with 14 or fewer entries:
      1. Three preliminary rounds.
      1. Finals directly.

## Tiebreaker Criteria

A.  Breaks to Semi-Finals
    1. Determined by the lowest cumulative score (truncated to 5).
    1. Reciprocal ranks are used as a tie-breaker.

A.  Breaks to Finals
    1. Determined by the total cumulative score from preliminary and semi-final rounds (truncated to 5).
    1. Tie-breakers applied in the following order:
        1. Ranks from elimination rounds.
        1. Judges' preference on ranks from elimination rounds.
        1. Reciprocal ranks from semi-finals.
        1. Reciprocal ranks from all rounds.
        
A.  Final Placement
    1. Based on cumulative ranks from all rounds (semi-finals and finals ranks doubled).
    1. Tie-breakers applied in the following order:
        1. Ranks from the final round.
        1. Judges' preference on ranks from the final round.
        1. Reciprocal ranks from the final round.
        1. Reciprocal ranks from all rounds.

# Debate Events

## Small Entry Contingency Rule
A.  This section only applies if the number of entries is equal to or less than the number of qual spots.
A.  All entries qualify automatically to state and do not need to conduct any debate rounds nor physically attend the qualifying yournament.
      1. If CHSSA by-laws require qualification round debates to be held, CHSSA rules supersede CVFL rules, and the rounds must be held. As of March 2025, the closest bylaw that addresses this is CHSSA Article VII.6.D.2.a, which states "The League shall hold the tournament or event(s) to determine the qualifiers for that League. For example, if League X should have three qualifiers in oratory and there were fewer than five schools entered in oratory, League X would hold the event at the state qualification tournament to determine its top three contestants." This does not seem to address the case where there are fewer entries than the number of qual spots, however.
A.  Coaches of teams in a small-entry event may request that their teams debate during some or all of the preliminary rounds. CVFL will accomodate these requests to the extent possible, considering opponent availability, judge availability, and room availability.

## Preliminary Rounds
A.  Three preliminary rounds, each judged by 1 judge.
B.  Round 1 is randomly paired.
C.  Rounds 2 and 3 are power-matched, avoiding school conflicts if possible (if unavoidable, the affected coach will be informed at the start of the tournament).
      1. Pull-ups will be used to avoid school conflicts during prelims, if required.

## Bracket Creation
A.  After Round 3, teams with one or fewer losses advance to elimination rounds.
A.  Teams are seeded based on:
    1. Number of debates won.
    1. Average seed of opponents faced.

## Elimination Rounds

A.  Elimination rounds should be judged by a panel of 3 judges.
A.  Brackets are set as follows:
    1. If 8 or fewer advancing entries, start with quarter-finals.
    1. If 9-16 advancing entries, start with octo-finals.
    1. Pairings are set with 1st vs. 8th/16th, 2nd vs. 7th/15th, etc.
        1. Byes fill remaining slots if necessary (eg. if no 16th seed, 1st seed gets a bye).
    1. Single elimination until the final qualifying round.
    1. Brackets are never "broken" -- that is, pairings are **not** modified to avoid matchups between the same school.

## Final Qualifiers
A.  Winners of the final qualifying round automatically qualify.
A.  Additional qualifiers are determined from the best-performing final-round-losing entries based on:
    1. Number of ballots won.
    1. Number of debates won.
    1. Opponents' cumulative ballots won.
    1. Opponents' cumulative ballots won against them.

# Congressional Debate

## Preliminary Rounds
A.  Number of chambers determined by entries and presiding officers (typically two chambers for entry counts above 20).
A.  Three preliminary rounds with static chamber assignments.
A.  Presiding Officers (POs) rotate chambers to ensure exposure.

## Breaks to Finals
A.  Ranks to finals determined by:
    1. Lowest cumulative total rank (truncated to 10).
    1. Judges' preference in head-to-head ties.
    1. Reciprocal ranks (truncated to 10).

## Final Rounds
A.  Equal numbers of competitors from each chamber advance to finals (e.g., seven from each in a two-chamber setup).
A.  Final scoring:
        1. Lowest cumulative ranks from preliminaries and finals (finals ranks doubled, truncated to 10).
        1. Ranks from the finals round.
        1. Judges' preference from finals.
        1. Reciprocal ranks from the finals.
        1. Reciprocal ranks from all rounds.

## Judging
A.  Preliminary rounds: three judges per chamber.
A.  Final round: at least three judges.

# Presiding Officer Competition
A.  POs are ranked based on votes from students and judges in each round.
A.  Top two POs with the most votes advance to finals, with total votes serving as the tie-breaker.

# Additional Notes

Debate events typically do not run full 16-entry brackets due to judging constraints. Smaller brackets (e.g., quarter-finals) streamline the schedule and ensure smoother operations.

These rules aim to balance adherence to CHSSA guidelines with the practical needs of our league.
